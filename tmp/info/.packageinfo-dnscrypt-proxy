Title: A tool for securing communications between a client and a DNS resolver
Maintainer: Black Roland https://forum.openwrt.org/profile.php?id=82621
Source: dnscrypt-proxy-1.3.2.tar.bz2
Type: ipkg
Description: 	The DNSCrypt protocol is very similar to DNSCurve, but focuses on
	securing communications between a client and its first-level resolver.
	While not providing end-to-end security, it protects the local network
	(which is often the weakest link in the chain) against
	man-in-the-middle attacks. It also provides some confidentiality to
	DNS queries.
